// Consider this to be under MIT license. It's largely based an an Open Source
// Decoder for Java under GPL, while I looked at another Decoder from Nokia
// (under no particular license?) for certain aspects.
// I'm not sure if this work is "derivative" enough to have a different license
// but then again, who still cares about MPEG1?
